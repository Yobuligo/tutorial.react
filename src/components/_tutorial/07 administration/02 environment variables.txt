In React it is possible to use environment variables to provide information about the landscape an application is running.
E.g. the database my change some user information or whatever. 
There are already predefined variables like "process.env.NODE_ENV". "process.env.NODE_ENV" for example provides information about the environment itself, if it is a development, test or productive environment.

Adding own environment variables.

1.  Add .env file
    The first step is to add a file ".env", which must be provided on root-level, which means on the level of package.json.

2.  Set parameter
    The environment variables are key value pairs. As each parameter is converted to a string, there is no need to provide quotes. 
    Import is to add the prefix "REACT_APP_*", otherwise this parameter will be ignored, to not override other parameters from the system which have the same name.
    An example would be:

    REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL=http://development-database.com

3.  Access parameter
    The parameters are accessible via global variable "process.env.*". So to access the database url the access would be e.g.:

    <h1>{process.env.REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL}</h1>

4.  Restart Server
    Important to know is, that whenever a parameter was added or changed it is required to restart the server. Otherwise the old set of parameters would be used.
    Restart means to call: npm start
