Next to centralize environment variables it is also possible to have separate environment variables for e.g. development and production.
Therefore create to separate files which contain the variables for the corresponding system type.

    .env.development
    .env.production

But it seems you have to install a separate package to use it and to adjust the script for "build" or "test" by providing the files which should be used.

Keep in mind, these files shouldn't contain any keys. So better exclude the files from git by adding it to .gitignore.
