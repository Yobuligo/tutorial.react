 * 1. At the beginning the values of this form seems to be correct (even so nothing was entered)
 * 2. When pressing the submit button it becomes invalid
 * 3. when entering the input and directly leaving the input (losing focus), it becomes invalid
 * 4. when entering a value the state changed from valid to invalid. Depending on the input
