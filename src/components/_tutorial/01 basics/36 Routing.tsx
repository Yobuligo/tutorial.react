// As a React Application is a single page application (SPA) there is no need to provide several HTML files for different pages which are loaded on demand.
// Instead the whole application is transmitted to the client and by click events and input events the content of the page change.
// But what if we want to use the possibility to navigate between pages by using /<name>? within the URL? 
// Here routing comes to place.

export const Routing: React.FC = ()=>{
    return <></>
