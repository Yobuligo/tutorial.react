// Controlled vs uncontrolled components is an idiom.
// Controlled components are components which are controlled via React. When using useState, React controls the components.
// Uncontrolled components are components which are not controlled via React. When using useRef, you directly interact with the DOM and not with React which controls the DOM.

export const ControlledAndUnControlledComponents = () => {
  return <></>;
};
