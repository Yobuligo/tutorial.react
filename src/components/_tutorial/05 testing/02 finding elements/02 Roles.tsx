/**
 * Roles are used to identify elements in a react application.
 * Normally those roles shouldn't be set manually.
 * 
 * The following roles are default:
 * Banner -> e.g. header
 * button -> button
 * checkbox -> <input type="checkbox" />
 * ContentInfo -> e.g. footer
 * heading -> h1 - h6
 * img -> Img
 * list -> ul, li
 * link -> a
 * radio -> <input type="radio" />
 * spinbutton -> <input type="number" />
 * textbox -> <input type="textbox" />
 * 
 * full list: https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#docconformance
 * 
 * Also it is possible to create a rtl-book with all roles, which are provided by the udemy course.
 * This can be achieved by calling:
 * "npx rtl-book serve roles-notes.js"
